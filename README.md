# Homework Instructions

This is your repository for the Homework assignment. To work with these files on your own computer, click on the "Code" button and then choose "Download ZIP". After uncompressing the folder and saving the files in a folder on your local computer, click .Rproj file to open the assignment in RStudio. Proceed by completing necessary R code in the hw.RMD file. Once you complete the assignment, upload the changed files from your RStudio project to GitHub and click on "Commit changes." This will keep your repository up-to-date and make your code available to me if you have any questions. However, you must also submit your files to codePost for assignment grading. Do this as soon as you have code finished to get early feedback, since codePost will run some auto-grading tests upon submission.
